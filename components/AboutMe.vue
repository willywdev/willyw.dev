      I'm the self-proclaimed code wizard who transforms endless coffee into
      somewhat functional code, with a special love for JavaScript and Rust. My
      coding journey feels like I've been trying to debug my lifeâ€”full of
      surprises and facepalm moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've somehow managed to collect a quirky toolkit of skills, enabling me to
      whip up apps that are fast, sturdy, and mostly secure (because, let's face
      it, there's always that one bug...).
